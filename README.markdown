## üìù Project Description
A **lightweight machine learning system** that runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to classify **2D and 3D geometric shapes** (circles, cylinders, cubes, etc.) using OpenCV.  
The classifier is paired with a **Vite + React site** that lets you **interactively move and visualize shapes** in real time.

## üòÇ The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Geometric imposters are everywhere‚Äîcylinders pretending to be pillars, circles acting like spheres. Chaos! Confusion! Geometrical identity crises!

---

## üí° The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A **shape sheriff** powered by Raspberry Pi and machine learning that detects and classifies these rogue forms.  
And because we can, a **React-based control panel** lets you move shapes around the screen like a bored deity rearranging the universe.

## ‚öô Implementation

### **1. Raspberry Pi Shape Classifier**
**Pipeline:**
1. **Image Preprocessing** ‚Äì Convert to grayscale, resize, normalize
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Contour analysis, edge detection
3. **Classification** ‚Äì Train a `scikit-learn` model on shape datasets
4. **Prediction** ‚Äì Output shape name + confidence score

**Install & Run:**
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy scikit-learn psutil
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lightweight-shape-classifier.git
cd lightweight-shape-classifier
python geoImg2.py
Run
python geoImg2.py

For testing memory usage:
python geoImg2.py --test-memory `
```
