Team Lead: Aaron Bosh Macsimus - College Of Engineering Thalassery

Project Description
A lightweight machine learning system to classify 2D and 3D geometric shapes like circles, cylinders, and cubes using OpenCV and minimal resources, optimized for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world is plagued by rogue shapes sneaking into photos, confusing everyone with their geometric audacity‚Äîcircles pretending to be spheres, cylinders masquerading as pillars!
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Unleash a Raspberry Pi-powered shape sheriff to detect and classify these sneaky shapes with laser-focused contour analysis and a sprinkle of machine learning magic, saving the day one polygon at a time!
